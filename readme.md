# Quarto

## Overview

This is an experiment where I rebuilt the [Quarto board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarto_(board_game)) using a binary representation.

I also experimented with [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev) and [Jujutsu version control](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) system.

## Setup

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Get Started

Start the dev server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Build the app for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
pnpm preview
```
